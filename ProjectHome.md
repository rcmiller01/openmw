## About OpenMW ##
OpenMW is a new engine for 2002's Game of the Year, The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind. It aims to be a fully playable (and improved!), open source implementation of the game's engine and functionality. You will still need the original game data to play OpenMW. OpenMW will run on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

## The Project ##
This Google Code page is used to host all OpenMW's releases, which are freely downloadable to everyone. Currently all our releases are in BETA, and you will not be able to fully play through Morrowind yet with OpenMW.
